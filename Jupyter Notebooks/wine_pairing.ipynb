Try pairing with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The District 7 Estate Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.', 'Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Beef. Beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Sterling Vineyards Merlot with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 29 dollars per bottle.', \"Chili can be paired with Cava, Grenache, and Shiraz. These juicy reds don't have too much tannin (important for spicy foods), but a sparkling wine like cava can tame the heat even better. The Segura Viudas Brut Reserva Heredad Cava with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 22 dollars per bottle.\", 'Burger can be paired with Malbec, Merlot, and Zinfandel. Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel. You could try Ernesto Catena Padrillos Malbec. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.8 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 15 dollars per bottle.', \"Stew can be paired with Cabernet Sauvignon, Chablis, and Malbec. Full-bodied red wines like malbec and cabernet sauvignon are the perfect accompaniment for beef stew. Fish stew probably calls for a white wine, such as chablis. You could try Elway's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon Wine. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 78 dollars per bottle.\", 'Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Prime Rib. Beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. One wine you could try is Black River Winery Merlot. It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 10 dollars.', 'Beef Ribs on the menu? Try pairing with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir. Beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Clos Du Val Merlot with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 30 dollars per bottle.', \"Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are great choices for Cod. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 26 dollars per bottle.\", 'Crab works really well with Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, and Riesling. Chilled crab tastes great with pinot grigio. Warm crab (especially with butter) can be matched with a buttery Chardonnay or a crisp fruity Riesling. The CalNaturale Chardonnay Lodi with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle.', \"Clams can be paired with Chardonnay, Muscadet, and Riesling. Buttery chardonnay is great for scallops, shrimp, crab, and lobster, while muscadet is a classic pick for mussels, oysters, and clams. If you've got some spice in your shellfish, a semi-dry riesling can balance out the heat. The CalNaturale Chardonnay Lodi with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 11 dollars per bottle.\", 'Salad works really well with Chardonnay, Gruener Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Mercer Estates Zephyr Ridge Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 35 dollars per bottle.', \"Brisket works really well with Shiraz, Tempranillo, and Zinfandel. All these red wines can handle the meaty, smokey flavor of brisket. If you're talking traditional Jewish brisket, you'll want to look for a kosher red wine. One wine you could try is Penfolds Bin 8 Cabernet-Shiraz. It has 4.1 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 20 dollars.\", 'Albarino, rosé Wine, and Sauvignon Blanc are my top picks for Gumbo. These low-tannin, lower alcohol wines will complement the heat in spicy cajun dishes, instead of making your mouth burn more. The Salneval Albarino with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 9 dollars per bottle.', 'Meatloaf can be paired with Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon. Meatloaf will work with many red wines. We recommend something bold and fruity, like a Cabernet Sauvignon or Zinfandel. You could try McFadden Old Vine Zinfandel. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 24 dollars per bottle.', \"Paellan on the menu? Try pairing with Tempranillo, Albarino, and Grenache. When pairing wine with Spanish dishes, why not follow the rule 'what grows together goes together'? We recommend albariño for white wine and garnachan and tempranillo for red. The Matchbook Tempranillo Wine with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 15 dollars per bottle.\", \"Tempranillo, Albarino, and Grenache are my top picks for Empanada. When pairing wine with Spanish dishes, why not follow the rule 'what grows together goes together'? We recommend albariño for white wine and garnachan and tempranillo for red.

It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.\", 'Pho works really well with Chenin Blanc, Gewurztraminer, and Riesling. The best wine for Asian food depends on the cuisine and dish - of course - but these acidic whites pair with a number of traditional meals, spicy or not. You could try Pine Ridge Chenin Blanc - Viognier. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle.', 'Riesling, Gruener Veltliner, and Sparkling rosé are my top picks for Chole. The best wine for Indian food will depending on the dish, of course, but these picks can be served chilled and have some sweetness to complement the spiciness and complex flavors of a wide variety of traditional dishes. The Chateau Ste. Michelle Dry Riesling with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 10 dollars per bottle.', \"Riesling, Gewurztraminer, and Pinot Gris are great choices for Caribbean.

You could try Lucien Albrecht Reserve Gewurztraminer. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 18 dollars per bottle.\", 'African on the menu? Try pairing with Pinotage, Riesling, and Chenin Blanc. The best wine for African dishes will depend on the dish, but a fruity, aromatic white wine is a safe bet for spicy dishes while pinotage would be a traditional match for South African cuisine. The Chateau Ste. Michelle Dry Riesling with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 10 dollars per bottle.', 'Piri Piri Chicken works really well with Pinotage, Chenin Blanc, and Riesling.
